          <p>
            Hi, I'm Dave. I'm a (contract) senior frontend developer currently in contract at Vodafone / MMT Digital.
            I'm currently working on ... that is used
          </p>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a frontend developer with 20 years experience. I've worked with companies such as Vodafone, MMT Digital,
            Maersk and Virgin Media as well as many smaller agencies. I'm currently working on ... that is used
          </p>

          <h2>Work experience</h2>

              <p>
                I was contracted as a React developer by MMT Digital and placed in a cross-functional agile team within
                Vodafone to develop an exploratory sub-brand. The development unit was small, yet three months later, we
                delivered VodafoneÊ¼s own youth-targeted MVNO proposition called VOXI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many initiatives followed, including handset financing, an online shop and Vodafone to VOXI migration
                journeys. The role quickly evolved into full-stack as the need for a set of Node.JS micro-services
                became apparent. Even so, a keen focus was always trained on React development and close to three years
                later, with the proposition growing substantially (in what is a declining market), we embraced a set of
                features designed to mature the frontend aspects of the codebase.
              </p>

          I write clear & intuitive code, I architect reusable components & modules, and am as comfortable building user interfaces & integrating APIs as I am writing backends in Node.js. I possess a problem-solving mindset with a thirst for learning that continues to mature my knowledge of front & back-end technologies.
Practiced in agile methodologies, I'm a proven team player, and believe products are grown through cross-function collaboration. I'm both flexible & adaptable, am sympathetic to timeframes & constraints, and thrive when cultivating a product that yields to the demands of the customer.
