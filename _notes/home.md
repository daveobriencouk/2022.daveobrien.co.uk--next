# Ahoy ðŸ‘‹. I'm Dave, and I'm a Frontend engineer.

I'm currently in contract with MMT Digital, working at Vodafone. I've been writing code since font tags were all the rage.

I've seen lots of things come, go and stick. I've seen lots of things work well, and lots of things break. And when Iâ€™m not seeing things, I love to code.
