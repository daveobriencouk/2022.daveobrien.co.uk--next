With over 20 years of frontend engineering experience, I leverage technologies such as TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML to craft engaging user experiences. My diverse career spans work with industry leaders such as Vodafone, Virgin Media, and Maersk, demonstrating my comprehensive skills in UI design, API integration, and varied aspects of backend development.

As an avid Agile practitioner, I thrive within collaborative environments, consistently delivering timely, high-quality solutions centred around the end-user's needs.
