With a seamless transition from my previous position at Telewest, I joined Virgin Media and successfully took on new responsibilities during my tenure. My main responsibility was to audit and migrate Telewest's legacy Help channel, followed by planning and developing Virgin Media's own Help channel. Leveraging my previous experience, I successfully collaborated with wider teams to coordinate legacy content channels and honed my ability to work within CMS's technical constraints. Additionally, I developed expertise in creating engaging, topical, and traffic-generating content.
