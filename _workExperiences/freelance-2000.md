I had the opportunity to rent studio space within a market research agency, where I collaborated with a senior designer in a piecemeal apprenticeship. This experience allowed me to gain valuable insights into creative thinking, production, and client management. I successfully secured regular clients and worked collaboratively on various projects, spanning print-based corporate identities and marketing materials to digital initiatives like splash animations and web banners. This role not only provided me with a solid understanding of industry fundamentals and the real-world creative process but also honed my skills in client communication and management.
