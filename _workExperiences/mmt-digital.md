In 2017, I joined MMT Digital as a contract React developer, assigned to a cross-functional Agile team within Vodafone. Our initial project focused on the development of a new sub-brand, VOXI, a youth-targeted MVNO proposition. Despite our team's small size, we successfully launched VOXI within a three-month timeframe.

Following this, I worked on various initiatives such as handset financing, an online shop, and migration journeys from Vodafone to VOXI. During this time, my role evolved into a full-stack developer, mainly focusing on developing a suite of Node.JS microservices. However, React development remained a critical aspect of my responsibilities. As the brand grew significantly in a declining market, we continually enhanced the frontend aspects of the codebase.

In the subsequent years, I transitioned to Vodafone's business enterprise division. Here, I was tasked with the upkeep of order management pages and the development of an enterprise-level broadband product availability check and ordering journey using React Query and JSON Forms. Alongside this, I also undertook the revamp of various legacy applications and libraries, migrating them to modern internal boilerplates. In addition, I handled a significant amount of technical debt tasks, such as vulnerability and package updates, and Vite uplifting.

#### Core responsibilities

- Designing and building UIs based on specific requirements.
- Constructing state management solutions for business logic and API integrations.
- Integrating backend services following needs and Swagger documentation.
- Developing Node.JS microservices to meet business requirements.
- Collaborating closely with the development and UX/UI team on all aspects of the stories in-sprint.
- Facilitating build and release processes.
- Supporting the team in user story creation and mentoring.
- Gathering PI goals and distilling them into epics, features, and user stories.
- Working with stakeholders to deliver suitable MVP propositions.
- Collaborating with marketing and UX/UI teams to effectively develop propositions.

#### Key achievements

- Launch of marketing, acquisition, and in-life journeys for VOXI within three months.
- Release of an online shop with PayPal integration via Braintree API.
- Rebuilding of our MVP service authentication mechanism.
- Formulation of a technological and process blueprint that was replicated throughout the business.
- Addressing technical debt systematically, including rehabilitating forms using Formik, reducing page-level boilerplate via HOCs and hooks, rewriting account microservices, refactoring payment integration, restructuring our application, and rebuilding product architecture.
- Architecting and building an enterprise-level broadband product availability check and ordering journey.
- Developing a reusable set of packages for a stepped procedural form journey based on JCS services, with state management handled by backend responses, data schemas, and partial submission endpoints.
