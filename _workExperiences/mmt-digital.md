In 2017, I joined MMT Digital as a contract React developer, assigned to a cross-functional Agile team within Vodafone. Our initial project focused on developing a new sub-brand, VOXI, aimed at a younger audience. Despite our team's small size, we successfully launched VOXI within a three-month timeframe.

Subsequently, I worked on various initiatives including handset financing, e-commerce solutions, and seamless migration pathways between Vodafone and VOXI. As my role evolved into that of a full-stack developer, I balanced my React responsibilities with developing a suite of Express.js microservices to fill gaps in our existing service architecture.

I eventually transitioned to Vodafone's Business Enterprise Division, where my responsibilities expanded to include the maintenance of order management pages and the development of an enterprise-level broadband product availability check and ordering journey. In this role, I've also focused on modernising legacy applications and proactively addressing significant technical debt, including vulnerability and package updates. Most recently, I've been engrossed in crafting reusable frontend assets that enable the construction of backend-driven, stepped form journeysâ€”a task that stands as some of the most challenging and engaging work I've undertaken in recent times.

#### Core responsibilities

- Design and build UIs based on specific UX guidelines and business requirements.
- Construct state management solutions for business logic and API integrations.
- Integrate backend services according to needs and Swagger documentation.
- Developed Express.js middleware to fill gaps in our existing architecture.
- Collaborate closely with scrum team to deliver sprint goals.
- Facilitate build and release processes.
- Support the team in user story development and refinement.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to define and deliver MVPs aligned with business objectives.

#### Key achievements

- Launched marketing, acquisition, and in-life journeys for VOXI within three months.
- Released an online shop with PayPal integration via Braintree API.
- Rebuilt the MVP service authentication mechanism.
- Reduced technical debt by optimising forms with Formik & React Hook Form, minimising page boilerplate via HOCs and hooks, and refactoring account services and payment integration.
- Architected and built an enterprise-level broadband product availability check and ordering journey.
- Developed a comprehensive package set of reusable frontend assets that facilitated the creation of backend-driven, stepped form journeys, thereby driving state management via journey composition services and data schemas.
