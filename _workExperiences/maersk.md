At the outset of my contract with Maersk, I was brought in to replace the Lead Developer on a challenging project aimed at building the next iteration of a self-service application. The project involved complex business requirements such as multi-branding, localisation, and support for Internet Explorer 8.

#### Core responsibilities

- Developed robust business logic based on UX and project requirements
- Build view logic, templates, and UI components in line with UX and visual design specifications.
- Took the lead as the UI resource on the core project.
- Collaborate closely with BAs, UX & UI designers, and backend developers to translate requirements into functional solutions.
- Contributed to cross-project initiatives aimed at harmonising the UI across the entire program.

#### Key achievements

- Architected and executed a proof of concept for an atomic approach using the existing UI library.
- Integrated modeling into the single-page application.
- Established and enforced a standardised approach to UI component development.
