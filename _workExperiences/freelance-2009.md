During an interim year between full-time positions, I dedicated my efforts to client projects that expanded my proficiency in CMS and ecommerce development (including on and off-site payment processing), PHP, JavaScript, and server administration. Through these projects, I not only strengthened my technical capabilities but also witnessed growth in my client liaison and general business skills. Some notable projects I worked on include a subscription-based ecommerce store for downloadable HR products, an agency-based portfolio site centered around a custom JavaScript gallery, and an employment law website with optimised registration conversion flows.
