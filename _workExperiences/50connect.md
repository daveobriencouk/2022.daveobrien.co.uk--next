Throughout my two-year tenure at 50connect, I successfully maintained and developed the revamped over 50's portal and its supporting channels. As the sole developer, I prioritised efficiency and focused on clear and well-defined features, while continuously monitoring site goals to identify areas for improvement. This role propelled my approach to user experience (UX), challenged my CMS implementation skills, and significantly enhanced my frontend expertise. Noteworthy projects included the redevelopment and design of portal pages, new registration flows, and forums, as well as the integration of various third-party systems like Open Adstream, Google Analytics and advertiser APIs.
