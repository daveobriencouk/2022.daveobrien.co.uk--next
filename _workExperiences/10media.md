During my time at 10Media, a former client, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in my passion for web design. In this role, I gained invaluable experience by designing and building various online properties. Initially, I supported advertising campaigns by creating HTML emails, web banners, data capture pages, and microsites. As the role progressed, I played a key role in team growth, cultivated an impressive portfolio of independent clients, and established an efficient development process. This experience marked my transition from graphic design to focusing solely on web design, deepening my expertise in web development processes, coding standards, and user-centric design.
