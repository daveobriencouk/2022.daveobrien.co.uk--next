While at Ego Creative, I assumed the role of the sole developer and played a pivotal part in establishing a robust digital team and infrastructure to cater to our clients' needs. Our focus encompassed a diverse range of digital solutions, including customised frontend builds, CMS development, and ecommerce solutions.

#### Core responsibilities

- Leading web projects of all sizes, from landing pages to multi-channel portals
- Defining, planning, and executing web solutions based on client requirements
- Developing complex frontend components, featuring JavaScript-centric interfaces and API integrations
- Building comprehensive CMS solutions, encompassing frontend integration, custom development, and content modeling
- Providing valuable knowledge support to fellow developers, visual designers, project managers and clients
- Collaborating with clients throughout the project lifecycle, from initial definition to post-launch support

#### Key achievements

- Overhauled the development processes, introducing a core framework incorporating discovery, user journey mapping, wireframing, and prototyping phases. This included implementing component-based development, creating templates and generators, establishing coding standards and guidelines, and automating tasks and release procedures.
- Initiated the adoption of technologies, such as advanced tooling, preprocessors, and JS & CSS frameworks, to enhance project efficiency and deliver cutting-edge solutions.
- Established a user-centric approach to development, ensuring alignment with site goals, optimal user flows, and effective prototyping methodologies.
- Noteworthy achievements include the development of a careers guidance website with intricate ecommerce implementation, a customised booking and reservation interface, a multi-path audience selector, and a streamlined single-page checkout process. Additionally, I led the creation of a price comparison app, encompassing comprehensive comparison management, complex calculations, data synchronisation, user authentication, and reporting functionalities.
