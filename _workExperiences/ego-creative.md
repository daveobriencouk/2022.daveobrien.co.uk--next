As the sole developer at Ego, I played a key role in assembling a digital team and establishing mechanisms to service our clients. Our projects spanned a wide range of digital solutions, including bespoke frontend builds, CMS development, and e-commerce solutions.

#### Responsibilities

- Leading web projects of all sizes, from landing pages to multi-channel portals
- Defining, planning, and executing web solutions based on client requirements
- Developing frontend components, including complex JavaScript-centric interfaces and API integrations
- Building CMS solutions, including frontend integration, custom development, and content modelling
- Providing technical support to developers, visual designers, and project managers
- Collaborating with clients for project definition, management, and post-launch support

#### Achievements

- Overhauled processes, including a core process that included discovery, user journey mapping, wire-framing & prototyping phases. Changes to build processes included component-based development, template & generator creation, coding standards & guidelines, task automation, and release procedures
- Initiated the adoption of new technologies, including tooling, pre-processors, and JS & CSS frameworks
- Instituted a user-centric approach to development, based on site goals, user flows, and prototyping
- Developed notable solutions such as a complex careers guidance website (e-commerce implementation, custom booking & reservation interface, a multi-path audience selector & single-page checkout), and a price comparison app with comprehensive features such as comparison management, estimation calculator, data synchronization, user authentication, and reporting
