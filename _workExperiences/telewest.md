At Telewest, I successfully redeveloped the Help channel on the blueyonder customer portal, improving its readability, usability, and aesthetics. This led to additional projects focused on enhancing purchase uptake, customer knowledge, and user flows within the Services channel. I effectively managed daily operations, scheduling, and performance measurement of Help and Services promotion. Through strategic measurement, planning, and implementation, I significantly increased web traffic and revenue, including a notable 50% boost in net revenue share for blueyonder's photo service within the first month. This role honed my ability to measure success, work within CMS constraints, develop technical writing skills, and collaborate effectively within a self-serving team.
