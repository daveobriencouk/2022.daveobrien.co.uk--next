As the sole graphic designer for Xtreme Magazine, an independent publication, I had the privilege of joining the team during its developmental stage shortly after college. In this role, I was responsible for the conceptual design of the magazine's identity, the creation of page spreads, and as the design team expanded, I took on organisation and management duties. This experience provided me with invaluable real-world design and production expertise, including crash courses in industry concepts like production, artworking, and pre-flighting. Working in a professional design environment, I honed my collaborative skills while actively contributing to creative projects.
